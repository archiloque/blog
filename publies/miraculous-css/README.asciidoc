There`'s no end to the treadmill of new CSS frameworks.

But all of them have at least one of these problems, and sometimes all of them:

- 💀 Tied to a specific CSS approach
- 💀 Tied to a JavaScript framework
- 💀 Adds bloat to your CSS
- 💀 Requires a custom development workflow

Miraculous CSS is a breakthrough approach to CSS that has none of these limitations:

- 👍 Works with all kind of CSS
- 👍 Not linked to a JavaScript framework
- 👍 No bloat
- 👍 No change in development workflow

As an added bonus, it`'s self contained in a single file and highly customizable!

As with many other frameworks, it uses a declarative approach.

To add a specific CSS attribute to an element, annotate it with the attributes you want, using this easy to grasp syntax (the default `M_` prefix stands for miraculous, but it`'s configurable):

[source,html]
----
<div class="M_display_flex">
  <!-- bla bla bla -->
</div>
----

When the page is loaded, a very short JavaScript snippet generates the relevant CSS and adds it to the page:

[source,css]
----
.M_display_flex {
  display: flex;
}
----

This means the CSS is always up to date with the HTML, and for each page only the required CSS is generated.

Here`'s a more complex example that include the miraculous snippet, so you can paste it in your project and start hacking right away !

[source,html]
----
include::miraculous.html[]
----
