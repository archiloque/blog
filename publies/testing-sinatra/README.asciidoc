link:http://www.sinatrarb.com[Sinatra] is my framework of choice when writing simple Ruby applications for my personal needs.

link:https://github.com/brynary/rack-test[Rack:Test] is nice to test Sinatra applications in black box so it's enough when the application is an JSON API.
But when you write a classical web application that serves html pages it's easier to do some white box testing, and in Sinatra this means accessing the instance variables of the application.

The nice thing with Ruby is that it's so dynamic that when you use a framework easy to debug and you have a little patience, it's easy to transform a black box into a white one.

As other may find this trick useful, this is a code sample to access your Sinatra app instance variables from your tests.

The application serving JSON and html:

[source,ruby]
.app.rb
----
include::app.rb[]
----

A very simple template:

[source,erb]
.index.html.erb
----
include::index.html.erb[]
----

And the test :

[source,ruby]
.test_app.rb
----
include::test_app.rb[]
----
