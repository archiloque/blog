For a link:../aoc2020/[fourth year] I did some link:https://adventofcode.com[advent of code].

== This year's advent of code

Compared to link:../aoc2020/[last year], the problems was OKish but I didn't really have fun except for a few problems.

Maybe I'm now too used to some types of problems (map exploration, interpreterâ€¦) so there is no sense of discovery any more, even when learning a new programming language.

Some exercices like the 8^th^or the 19^th^ really felt tedious (but maybe it's because I failed to find a better solution).

I even skipped exercices from the 24^th^ because I didn't have enough spoon to analyse the code to find the pattern that is probably here (so this day's code is only generating a somehow optimized Python code).

== Python

I wanted to learn some Python because I want to play with link:https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_quickstart.html[Blender's Python API].
As I'm experienced in Java and Ruby the Python syntax is not particulary alien to me, but I wanted some training before using it for a real project, to avoid dealing with too many unknown things at the same time.

As several of my coworkers are Python developers I'll avoid to post publicly my opinion about Python ðŸ˜¬.

Disclaimers:

. The bellow code is the first code I've written in Python, so it's probably more an exemple of Python written by a Ruby dev who spent too much type coding in Java than an example of good Python code.
. Code is provided as is, blablabla.
