. Recent JavaScript has link:https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/[many new features] that improves developers experience and makes easier to write clean code.
. Unfortunately, link:https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/[all browsers don't support all new features], specially old versions.
. To still be able to use the new features, developers use link:https://babeljs.io["`transpilers`"] than transform modern JavaScript into old JavaScript so old browsers can understand it.
. As a consequence, most of newly written JavaScript is deployed as old JavaScript.
. Developers working on browsers want to make them fast.
. Making a browser fast means making it faster for the most common intensive uses.
. Most common current intensive use of browser is massive JavaScript web applications "`transpiled`" into old JavaScript.
. Developers working on next generation browsers are spending their time to make them fast when executing next generation JavaScript that has been dumbed down to old JavaScript.
