:article_description: A new enterprise IT pattern
:article_image: zig.jpg

Thinking about link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns[unknown unknowns] I just identified a new enterprise IT pattern.

In classical literature, dysfunctional enterprise IT has four modes of doing projects:

[cols="^.^h,^.^,^.^",options="header"]
|===

|
|Business agree
|Business disagree

|IT agree
|Normal
|Ivory tower

|IT disagree
|Shadow IT
|Abomination

|===

* *Normal*: normal project, should be the case for most projects.
* *Shadow IT*: when the business do something the IT disagree with, canonical case is a PHP CMS which the IT wouldn`'t host.
* *Ivory tower*: cool-sounding technical projects done by IT without any business need, business may be forced to use it afterwards (see link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy[sunk cost fallacy]).
* *Abomination*: when something went terribly wrong, for example when IT and business disagreed and the conclusion is a bad settlement that doesn`'t satisfy any of the two sides, avoid these if you can.

But large multinational corporations have in fact several ITs. Most of the time they have local ITs and a "central" IT, in charge of IT strategy.

In this situation, you have not four but eight cases:

|Central IT disagree
|Normal
|Shadow shadow{nbsp}IT
|Small ivory tower
|Cosmic horror

|===

* *Magical unicorn*: everybody agrees, the system ensures it never happens.
* *Gotcha*: when the business and the central IT agrees on something the local IT won`'t be able to handle.
* *Large ivory tower*: both IT conspires to make a terrible mistake, good for resumes.
* *Alabaster ziggurat*: when the central IT decide all by itself, buzzword friendly projects like hybrid clouds lives here.
* *Normal*: local IT agree with local needs and they ignore central IT`'s Illusions of grandeurs.
* *Shadow shadow IT*: for ninjas, be sure you don`'t get spotted.
* *Small ivory tower*: they must fly under central IT`'s radar so normally you get only small catastrophes.
* *Cosmic horror*: everybody hates this project but it still happens, makes for great war stories a few years later.

Moral of this story: try to find the box you prefer and be sure to avoid the strange ones if you`'re not ready for them.
