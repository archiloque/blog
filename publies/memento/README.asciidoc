Each time I'm deleting some code I'm thinking about the time and effort that was spent writing it.

Even if with modern tools and techniques code is easier and faster to write, each line removed still took some effort to be created.

And this effort is now no more.

I wanted a kind of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori[memento mori], a shrine to remember the code that is now removed.

Here it is:

This simple script work on a git repository: each time you open the page it will fetch a randomly deleted line and will display it.

It requires Ruby and link:https://rack.github.io[Rack].

To run it:

[source,bash]
----
PATH_TO_GIT_REPO='path/to/your/git/dir' memento.ru
----

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:9292`

Code is a single file, under MIT license, so have fun and ping me if you do something interesting with it.

[source,ruby]
.memento.ru
----
include::memento.ru[]
----
