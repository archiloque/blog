For a second year I did some exercises from link:https://adventofcode.com[advent of code].

Like last year I've started several days after the official beginning to avoid the feel of being part of a competition or to have a fixed schedule.

Most of the exercises have the same qualities I appreciated in last year ones: not very long and don't require external knowledge, and especially no knowledge of specific algorithms.

And same for the things I disliked: 

- The writing theme that add flavor but makes some problems harder to understand.
- Exercises that feels like busywork when you have known about their problem domain, for example if you already read things about compilers, link:https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JoshGe/20170207/290928/Two_Years_of_Roguelike_Development_FAQs.php[roguelike development] and link:../building-git/[git], you already know how to solve most of the cases.
- Exercises with edge cases that are not tested in the provided samples so it makes harder to check if things work as expected.

I've stopped at problem 2 of day 18 because I've lost my interest in it, and I prefer to stop before it feels too much like work.

If you have comments or question about these please contact me.
