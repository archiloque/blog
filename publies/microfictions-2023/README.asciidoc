On January this year, I started to write a blog post draft entitled "`Developers should write fictions instead of programming languages`".

As usual with these articles, it was mostly addressed to my past self.

Like last year, I participated to link:../invisibles-networks-2023[Invisible networks], then started to write link:../microfictions[software development microfictions].

And then a few months ago, link:https://cohost.org/build-a-bot/[I] link:https://cohost.org/spy-thief-assassin-who[discovered] link:https://cohost.org/Making-up-Monsters[several] link:https://cohost.org/ImpressionsOfDetail[accounts] that post writing prompts on Cohost, which gave me ideas to write about.

I have now written enough stories to give me an excuse to publish a collection.

Most of them deal directly or indirectly with software and software development.
They are mostly SFW, with a few creepy ones.

It is available as link:./microfictions-2023.pdf[as a PDF] or link:./microfictions-2023.epub[as a EPUB].

Thanks for reading.
