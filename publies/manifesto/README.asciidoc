== How software manifestos sounded twenty years ago

* EATING BURNING HOT LAVA OVER GETTING ICE CREAM
* TRANSFORMING INTO A HUMONGOUS STAR-SHAPED ENTITY OVER KEEPING YOUR HUMAN FORM
* LIVING OUTSIDE SPACE AND TIME OVER ACCEPTING PHYSICAL REALITY
* KILLING GOD WITH YOUR BARE HANDS OVER LIVING A HAPPY LIFE

WE AGREE THE ITEMS ON THE RIGHT EXIST, BUT WE'LL MOCK YOU MERCYLESSLY IF YOU THINK THEY HAVE ANY VALUE, A̶L̴L̵ ̴H̶A̷I̸L̸ ̷T̶H̸E̴ ̴D̸A̶R̴K̸ ̵L̷O̷R̴D̵.

== How software manifestos sound now

* working code is nice, in some cases it may be better that non-working code
* trying to do useful things instead of things you don't need may be something to explore, but no biggie
* software development is often easier if you have a computer at your disposal, but ymmv
* this is a little fourth item, because all software manifestos should have four items

we hope you have a pleasant day, xoxo
