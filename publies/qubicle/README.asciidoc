For a personal project I want to generate some 3D voxel stuff.

After looking around for a good file format candidate, I discovered link:https://getqubicle.com/learn/article.php?id=22[Qubicle] format which is easy to understand and accepted by many tools.

I wrote a simple Ruby script for it, I hope it may help someone in need for this kind of stuff.

Code is available under MIT license.

[source,ruby]
.bloc.rb
----
include::bloc.rb[]
----

[source,ruby]
.qubicle.rb
----
include::qubicle.rb[]
----

Then to use it:

[source,ruby]
.main.rb
----
File.open('output.qb', 'wb') do |file|
    # create your content
    blocs = â€¦
    qubicle = Qubicle.new
    qubicle.write(blocs, file)
end
