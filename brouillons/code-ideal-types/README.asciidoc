Among programming languages, software types and texts about develoments, there are different types of ideal coding styles.

Calling them "`ideal`" means that they don't always match what standard programs looks like (as opposed to toy programs or programs or programs with a specific scope that are suited to the style) but they can be models people want to approach as much as possible.

A few examples :

- Programs where everything is computed at compile-time or startup time
- Programs where all code blocs aren't longer that 5 lines
- Programs where no call are direct because they all go through an indirection
- Programs that are so dynamics that looks like elaborates `eval(string)`
- Programs fully using a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system[entity component system]
- Programs where all the behaviors are managed and stored as data (in a database or in a database-like storage like link:../fichiers-de-configuration/[a configuration file]), and where all can even run in the database

These models often have an intellectual appeal because they are diehard: they provide a single solution to the complex topic of how to write your software.
This means they can trap developers' imagination, especially the developers who are frustrated by how baroque and mixed some systems are.

It can be easy to dismiss these models, 
specially when you work on a domain where they don't really work,
and when we're exposed to them by overzealous propagandists who tout their model of choice as the one true way to software.

On the other hand, I think that spending some time learning them from a good source can improve your code writing and design skills.

"`You should learn programming languages of different types`" is a common advice to increase the width a developper's knowledge, in theory because even if you don't use these languages, having been exposed to them means you can still incorporate some of their ideas{empty}footnote:[And sometimes create horrible mess and fight with your coworkers].

But focusing on programming languages means that{nbsp}:

* The unfamiliar syntax can makes understanding the ideas more difficult,
* It can be hard to isolate the ideas from the particular syntax,
