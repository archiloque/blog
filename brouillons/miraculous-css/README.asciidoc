:article_description: Probably a breakthrough, or maybe not

There's no end to the treadmill of new CSS frameworks.

But all of them have at least one of these problems, and sometimes all of them:

- Tied to a specific CSS approach
- Tied to a JavaScript framework
- Add bloat to your CSS
- Require to adapt your development workflow

Miraculous CSS is a breakthrough approach to CSS that has none of these limitation :

- 👍 Work with kind of CSS
- 👍 Not linked to a JavaScript framework
- 👍 No bloat
- 👍 No change in development workflow

As an added bonus, it's self contained in a single file and highly customizable !

As with many other framework, it uses a declarative approach.

To add a specific CSS attribute to an element, annotate it with the attributes you want, using this easy to grasp syntax (the default `M_` prefix stands for miraculous, but it's configurable):

[source,html]
----
<div class="M_display_flex">
    <!-- bla bla bla -->
</div>
----

When the page is loaded, a very short JavaScript snippet will generate the relevant CSS and add it to the page.

This means the CSS is always up to date with the HTML, and for each page only the required CSS is generated.

Here's a more complex example that include the miraculous snippet, so you can paste it in your project and start hacking right away !

[source,html]
----
include::miraculous.html[]
----
