. Video games I used to play when I was young
.. Those I bought because the box had cool art, but they were terrible
.. Those I got a pirated copy of and could not understand anything because I didn't had the manual (I played video games before the internet)
.. Those whose history was undecipherable because my english skills were not high enough
.. Those frustrated me before I understood that some video games were more difficult that other
.. Those I played with friends by sharing the controls, even if they were supposed to be single-player
.. The first of a series games I'm proud to have played on their original platforms because I was born at the right time
.. Those I watch a speedrun time to time for a nostalgia, because I feel that if I tried to play them I would lack the reflexes and patience and it would be horrible

. Video games I don't play
.. Those on platforms I don't own because I'm afraid buying one would lead me to spend too much time playing
.. Those I bought to support the developers knowingly I wouldn't play them
.. Those I wanted to play but I feared I wouldn't really like them, so I watched a full walkthrough video of them instead to avoid any risk of frustration

. Video games I would like to play
.. Those I'd like to play because it seems like I should enjoy them, but I don't
.. Those that don't exist because some particular game mechanics of design style I love is not compatible with current trends
.. The long games that required a level of mental stamina I don't have anymore
.. The multiplayer games because planning to play seem exhausting

. Video games I play
.. The gacha games I play non-stop for a few days until I can get a hold on myself and delete it
.. Those I play for one or two hours before I get the I understood the mechanic and all the fun disapear instantly, event if I still want to play them
.. Those who are not supposed to be fun with cheats, but who are you to tell me how I should be fun
