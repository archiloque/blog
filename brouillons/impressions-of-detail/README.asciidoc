But when you do that _one particular thing_, your reflection in the mirror breaks up into fuzz and jagged shapes, only swimming back to coherency when you stop.
____

– What is this? I though this bug was linked to the technology used in the previous pervious, it should not happen with the new serie. +
– You're right in theory, but some vocals users are really attached to the bug, so we had to painstakingly emulate it in the new version, it's enabled by default to please them but you can disable it from the advanced settings screen.

The murder weapon was a coffee-table art book title _The End_, consisting of glossy photographs of staged bloodstains.
____

– Lemme look in the book, I'm sure we'll find this particular pattern somewhere! +
– … No, wait +
— It could even be on the last page, with only blank pages after it! +
— Stop right now with your Mulder bullshit and read the report! +
– I'm reading! +
– And you don't notice anything? +
– Ehmmm, the victim has been bashed to death with the book and died of internal trauma, no visible blood. +

Welcome to our legal system! It is large and has many teeth.
____

– So now that we are finally here I want to know: why the teeth? +
– It's because of a ancient tradition related to… +
– I've read the changelog for the court application, the teeth are only here since the v3.0 released ten years ago, I didn't saw a single tooth in the V2 screenshots. +
– It's because of a clerical error, the company in charge of developing the v3.0 bought a very expensive teeth asset package, and making everything teeth-related was the best way we found to justify the spending to the the auditors.

Twelve newly-unearthed megaliths of local stone, buried since antiquity, describing the perimeter of a perfect square.
____

At least most of the work were done by drones so it wasn't so unpleasant if you could handle the dust, but you still wonder who is paying to restore these ancients macro LCD screens: what kind of message would you want to show on a monitor with 100 meters wide pixels.

The things that fire takes, and the things it capriciously leaves behind.
____

A way was needed to cleanse the tar pit of cursed things people continually see on the internet.

The repeated bad takes slowly decayed in the human psyche, poisoning the well that irrigates the next generation of ideas.

Scholars started to notice all the odd metaphors creeping in the discourses' water pipes.

Fire was the answer: its elemental nature was very potent against the brittle memes.
For months, the web smelt like cold smoke.

Then, new things started to grow from under the ashes, things that the fire forgot, or didn't dare to touch.

A single tree, growing where it should not, its shade welcome but its fruits unfamiliar.
____

Near the final boss spawning point, and just after the place where the game end credits roll, a tree is growing.

Adventurers often take a break leaning against its trunk, and take the opportunity to empty all the potions and drop all the scrolls that they hoarded during their play.

This unusual fertilizer has strange effects on the tree.

The branches look normal, and there are no voices to be heard in the sounds of the wind in its leaves, it's not that kind of tree.

But the fruits, the fruits are strange.
They have several colors, shapes and textures.

Some of them have potent magic properties, often several of them.

But nobody could figure out how to deduce the properties from a fruit's features, so if you brew a potion with them, it's impossible to know what it does without drinking it.

A really strong unpredictable magic source, tempting but useless for most people.

Tricksters, on the other hand, tricksters love it.

____
The mystifying part of the magic trick was not the one where the man vanished from inside the box, but the later part where it reopened with _three_ of him inside.
____

When the show is over, you politely ask the magician to make the two new ones disappear.
They answer it was not possible: the machine can only be used to clone, not to unclone.

Fuck, what will you do with three husbands?

Then you turn back to the magician and ask them to clone yourself, it wouldn't really fix the problem but on the other hand thinking about all the possible mischiefs makes you grin.

____
An exquisite clockwork bird, singing its piping song every day; but who's been winding it, all these years?
____

The clockwork bird was a part of the cognitohazard early warning system: the monitoring team was in charge of its maintenance and improvement.

Once the General Cooperation Agreement was signed and all this mess stopped, some of the facilities were preserved to be used to teach history and as a tourism attraction.

Engineering and history undergrads were tasked with the upkeep.

Since the sublimations, this place is under the control of the Dolls Covent, we trust them to care for it until it stops making sense.

____
A dense, crawling spiral of handwritten text swirls inward across the floor, like the black, thirsty hole of a drain that sucked down the scribbler's mind.
____

Another C-suite messed with the enterprise wiki because of quarterly delusion of grandeur, and here you are: spelunking the virtual recycle bin for some financial data for the compliance department.

The search engine was broken again, so the only solution was to skim the content yourself.

"`Making the wiki interface looking personal is good for engagement and makes people more eager to write and update content.`"

How a House of Leaves visual theme was good for engagement, who even decided to create it?

[quote]
____
A machine of no clear purpose but sinister mien, thundering endlessly behind a clean façade.
____

– What does this machine do? +
– As they say "`the purpose of a system is what it does`". +
– But what… +
– "`The system itself does not do what it says it is doing.`" +
– Why don't you… +
– "`The total behavior of large systems cannot be predicted.`" +
– Are you just… +
– "`In complex systems, malfunction and even total nonfunction may not be detectable for long periods, if ever.`" +
– So it's broken and you don't know what it's supposed to do? +
– Correct

____
A startling, running figure, shedding flowers as they hurtle through a library from which noise and rush have been successfully banished for generations.
____

The developer remembered that one of their long neglected pet projects contained some code they could use for their new darling, if they could find them.

Browsing their old projects set the developer in a strange mood: all these energy sparkles that turned to nothing.

They could burn the thing down and be done with it, but keeping them in storage gave the developer a specific kind of closure.

____
Everything that will be necessary, neatly packed: rope, ink, matches.
____

Since the last great war between departments, heists were the only way to change a user's personal information: you had to break into the vault, find their record, and carefully edit it.

An operation is planned for the next yearly OKR review, if they can convince the purchasing division to sign off for a barrel of gunpowder.

____
A cult, diminished; one last fervent believer, praying to the dark.
____

An ex-member, who moved to another clan a few years ago, slowly approached and sat near the fireplace.

– I wondered what happened to you, you're still welcome if you want to join. +
– No thanks, I still hope that things could change, they could decide to do the right thing. +
– I'm impressed by your determination, it has always been your forte, but it has been so long. +
– If I leave, nobody will dare ask for accessibility. I'm here for them.
