:article_description: Have the courage to admit what you really want

I've spend several years doing audits and other missions and I noticed that many organizations seem to care more about the planning and reporting of projects than about the content of the project (i.e. what the project is supposed to deliver).

My suggestion is to admit it, and have the courage to draw conclusions from it.

My idea is to try what I call "`eXtreme Project management`": focus on the project management part of the project, and just drop the other parts.

In a XP management, the project is composed of exactly two tasks:

. Planning
. Reporting

The same two tasks are recreated for each iteration.

Each project iteration is composed of four parts :

. A backlog grooming where you review the project's backlog, which is composed of the two aforementioned tasks.
. A poker planning, where you estimate the two tasks.
. A steering committee, where you share the project's reports with the stakeholders.
. A retrospective where you can gather feedbacks from the team and try to find improvements for the next iteration.

A typical XP management team should be composed of two person:

. A project owner, in charge of creating and updating the project tasks
. A scrum master, in charge of managing the Jira workflow and permissions

With an experienced team, an XP management iteration should typically take no more than 2 hours:

. Backlog grooming: 5 minutes
. Poker planning: 10 minutes
. Steering committee preparation: 30 minutes
. Steering committee: 1 hour
. Retrospective: 15 minutes
