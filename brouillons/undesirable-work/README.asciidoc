When exploring the potential challenges of a liberatory future, one of
the most frequent subjects we reflect upon is that of how our labor
might be organized to attend to the needs of all without domination and
hierarchy. There is no shortage of theory proposing various answers to
these questions and it is not my intention, in this essay, to do the
same. Rather, I intend to explore the root beliefs in one of the most
regular questions radicals of all tendencies are asked: "`How will we
make people do the dirty and undesirable work if there is no state or
police?`"

The answers we may offer are plentiful: "`Well, there's actually very few
jobs out there that someone won't do willingly for their communities!`"
"`Believe it or not there are people who really like that kind of dirty
job.`" "`We'll take turns doing the undesirable jobs.`" "`We'll provide
extra incentives for those who want to volunteer to do that work!`"
"`We'll advance automation to the point that no one needs to do that work
at all.`"
