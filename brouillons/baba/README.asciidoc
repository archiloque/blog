:article_description: Unfinished but still may be interesting

I love puzzle games and I love writing programs to solve them.

When link:https://www.hempuli.com/baba/[Baba Is You] was published I wanted to play it and to write a solver for it.

Then I decided to write about writing a solver.

Unfortunately, I stopped before reaching the moment where things become really complex, mostly because I had a new job so I wanted to explore new ideas.

But the 60+ pages of content is still here, and I think it's a good introduction to how to write puzzle game solvers.

I've link:../solveurs/[already written] (in French) why I think game solvers are interesting programming exercices because they are mostly about modeling and optimization, two topics where non trivial examples are hard to find.

Even if the projects is paused for the moment feedbacks are welcome.

The content is available in link:baba-is-you-all/baba.epub[EPUB] and link:baba-is-you-all/baba.pdf[PDF].
