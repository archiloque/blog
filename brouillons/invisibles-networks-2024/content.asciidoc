== tele-synesthetic

Modern software has become so complex to develop that writing code as a single person is a folk's tale.

To write code, you need a group of developers working together online, from 2 for the simplest tasks to 3 or 4 for the most complex ones, depending on the quantity of information that must be held in the team's distributed mind for the duration of the change.

To maintain a coherent representation of the code in such a group, using only words meant that only one person at a time could send information, while each person was looking at their own screen.
