I wrote the code to read the levels.
While I'd love to jump straight to the solving logic, I need to establish the game loop first. It's plumbing time!

This is fairly generic code, and I was able to port most of it from my previous link:https://github.com/archiloque/rgbexpress[efforts].

== The level

I'll use a `Level` class to hold all the data related to a game level.
For now it will just contain the level data we read from disk.
I know from experience that I'll add other data to simplify and speed up the calculations.

.Level.java
[source,java]
----
include::level1.java[]
----

My next class, the `State`, represents a state of the game being solved.
Just as the `Level`, it starts out as a small class with few attributes (the current status of the game and a reference to the `Level`) and it will become larger as I add features.
For instance, this is where I'll handle Baba's dynamically changing rules.

.State.java
[source,java]
----
include::state1.java[]
----

== The list of states

I could represent my list of game states as a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)[FIFO queue] to implement a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search[depth-first search] or as a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)[stack] for link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search[breadth-first search].

A FIFO may find a solution faster but the solution may be not be the shortest, a stack will find the solution that requires the lowest number of move, but requires more time and memory since it tends explore more possibilities before finding a solution.

Which works best depends on the game I'm solving.
Rather than choose by a fixed criterion, I just start from something that makes sense and tweak it as I go. 

I used a FIFO queue for my last project, let's use that again.

Rather than depend on an existing FIFO implementation, I just roll my own.
The code is short and it does exactly what I need and nothing more.
It's another thing to tweak when a solver hit a speed limit, in my last games this code was the faster.

.FiFoQueue.java
[source,java]
----
include::fifoqueue1.java[]
----

I now have all the elements I need to add state list management code to the `Level` class.

.Level.java
[source,java]
----
include::level2.java[]
----

Calling `State#processState` will add some new possible ``State``s to the list, so the minimal version of the solver loop is now complete.

== The entry point

Finally, my solver needs an entry point.

.App.java
[source,java]
----
include::app1.java[]
----

With the workflow completed, I can now run the program run and watch it solve its first level... well, kind of:

[source]
----
include::log1.txt[]
----

In the next part I'll put all the plumbing to good use and add some logic to the code.
