== Data volcano

Following the trends set by data lakes and data swamps, we're introducing a new data management pattern: the data volcano.

A data volcano is designed for the data that are too hot to be dealt with in a data lake.

Main feature of a data volcano:

- Need a full time of highly trained team to monitor it 24/7 equipped with a specialized gear to protect them from the data flumes,
- Instantly destroy any facility the data are deployed to with extreme prejudice,
- Constant temptation to hurl inconvenient people into it.

Availability is location-dependent, contact your local reseller for details.
