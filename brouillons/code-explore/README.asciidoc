When creating new programming languages, there are some beaten tracks like OO or macros.
It's not because a topic has already been searched a lot that it can't be futher improved.

But there's also a lot of underexplored zones.
Some of them can seem less welcoming, but it shouldn't stop us if we want to enhance things on the long terms.

Here's a few ideas:

* Places
** Lava
** Quicksand
** Drained swimming pools
** Liminal spaces
** Hidden caves behind waterfalls
** Mausoleums
* Life forms
** Dinosaurs
** Pickles
** Teeth
* General ideas
** Ancient curses
** That can be combined into a giant robot
** Neoplatonism
** Pettable software
** Code that change when you don't look at it
