Each time I worked in a team or organization where a level of self-organization was possible, the most complicated question was often "`Who do we deal with the undesirable work?`".

Unsurprisingly, it's an important topic of anarchist discussions, there have been practical answers and link:https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/lee-shevek-who-has-to-do-it[more long-term theoretical ones].

I was thinking about how this question applies to open source in general, and specifically to Linux distributions.

Linux distributions, in most cases, have much more users than people providing work.

Without even thinking about undesirable work, it means that from the beginning there is a strong imbalance.
Many Linux distributions makes efforts to transform users into contributors, but even a very successful program o this kind could not change the skewness.
