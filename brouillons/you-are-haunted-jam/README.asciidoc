== Walkthroughs before the internet

link:https://archiloque.itch.io/games-i-was-bad-at-on-my-amstrad-cpc[My first computer was an Amstrad CPC.]

It was the 1980's, we had no internet and the video games magazine we read were printed on paper.

I was (and still is) link:https://archiloque.itch.io/games-i-was-bad-at-on-my-amstrad-cpc[a heavy user of cheat codes].
A magazine called link:https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystick_(magazine)[Joystick] contained cheats and walkthroughs in each issues, and published a few link:https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=30&num=1154&album=oui["`bibles`"] collecting them.

I didn't knew the game the walkthroughs was supposed to solved, and they were published without any screenshot.
Only a few of them had a picture from their cover box or a drawing.

Loom

I On the wavers' island

At first go to the weavers' tents. Enter the leftmost tent, move forward, look at the tapestries and then go near the loom, there look at the scene. Take the stick and approach the egg, click on it and cast the open spell (eced), then get out of the tent. Go to the cemetery (take the road you took at the beginning but continue left, after the pontoon). Look into the holes in the trees and then go to the left, click into the brambles on the left, a rabbit comes out and an owl takes it. Look at the graves and turn right. Looking into the hole that was empty you learn the night vision. Go back to the tents, enter the first one on the right, click in the dark and cast the night vision spell.

From the walkthroughs' content I could daydream: what kind of game it was, in which universe, who was your character?

There's probably a Plato's cave thing somewhere, if you're into this kind of things.

Nowadays you could search the games name on the Internet and have screenshots and videos of it, but at the time I only had the game title and the list of actions to be done to solve it.

A game called "`The time doors`" probably means time travel was involved, but what was your role, what kind of mess were to trying to fix?

I didn't even knew what "`Loom`" meant, you seemed to be a kind of wizard who learnt spells, and there was a monster, and a swan.

In many games, the character is a blank slate so the player can project themselves in, these walkthroughs were kind of blank games I could recreated differently each time I dreamt about them.
