== We were meant to be gods, or so we have been told

Writing software _in theory_ should feel like being a god: you are in control of a little world, where your words have absolute power.
You can create and destroy things, make anything unique or clone it a million of times.
Most bad choices can be canceled, you can rewind history and pick another destiny.
When you care about something else, everything wait quietly for you to care about it again.

A computer is a little machine than makes you a god.

== Coding on the shoulders of elders gods

We even keep long and documented mythologies about the elders that created the tools we use.
From sand and mathematics they forged them, or so we've being told.

The socio-economics realities of their stories are often politely unmentioned, so it looks like they were working on a vacuum, following their own whims.

There is no Prometheus in our folklore: hubris is seen as a source of inspiration instead of being punished.

== Welcome to the grind

But _in reality_, writing software often feels like hell.

We're gods but most of what we do is tedious instead of being joyful and our tools are often broken in a way or another.

Instead of trying to create an Eden we often settle for things barely or mostly working.
Putting the bar higher means more efforts, a more fragile result, and then more maintenance on the long term.

Writing software often feels like a grind, a day after another the brokenness is eroding your good faith.

I'm curious if someone would rewriting the Bible with this kind of setup, how would the people react to this kind of god?

Instead of Prometheus you feel like Sisyphus, pushing a misshaped boulder that try to rolls on your toes.

== Wait, that's all?

For many people I know, the worse is the horrifying realization that it's all programming it about.

After listening to the folk tales, and thinking that creating software would probably feel even better than using them.
And their expectations are often based on the program they prefer, like a video game or a great site.

At first there is so much to learn so everything being a pain seems normal, and then they start to understand how to do stuff.

And understand that, indeed, the problem was not a lack of understanding or knowledge: we've been lied, our tools are bad and programming often feels like a misery.

And it's the same even the best and brightest, thanks to the social networks we can see that their work is mostly the same. The difference only seems that they are better at dealing with the bad parts, and have enough willpower to keep going.

It's still often be a comfortable and well paid job, if you can deal with the mess.

== It probably won't improve

The even sadder realization is that you can't probably make a difference: some software can be a joy to use, but creating software is still mostly not.

Productivity definitely improved, but not the overall experience.

You can try to improve things on a very small scale, trying to help people, trying to improve tools or trying to write replacements.
Many people do, some of them burn out doing it.

But when you consider the size of the problem, and the fact that it's not an accident but a direct consequence of the whole setup, including ultra-capitalism and exploitation of free work from some people, it won'y change a thing.

The only escape is to find an isolated niche with good enough tools and people, and don't wander too far from it to not being caught up by the mess.
