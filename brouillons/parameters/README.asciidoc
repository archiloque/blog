I'm fascinated by the fact that passing parameters to methods, or more exactly "`what is the _right_ way to pass parameters to methods ?`" is a recurring discussion, and I think that it can gives some insight about what we discuss when we discuss design, especially since this specific topic is at the crossword of several "`best practices`".

First let's introduce four ways to write the same-ish code.

First, the "`canonical`" case, nothing fancy:

[source,java]
----
include::example1.java[]
----

The the "`class`" approach, where the parameters are packaged in a class:

[source,java]
----
include::example2.java[]
----

Then the "`external`" approac

[source,java]
----
include::example3.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::example4.java[]
----
