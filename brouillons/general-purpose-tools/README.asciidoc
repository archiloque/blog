= General purposes tools, uncovered cases and advocacy

Imagine a computer tools that cover the standard needs of an established domain, which is what I call a general purpose tool.
For example it can be a programming language, a code editor or a network protocol.

Their opposite are tools that target a specific niche in a domain, for example tools that are designed for real-time requirements.

What differentiate general purposes tools in a same domain are of course their features and positioning, but also how they deal with the use cases they are not good at.

By "`they`" I mean the community around the tool: the org and/or people in charge of it, the official and unofficial supporters and other users that talk of it.

Because even if a tool cover lots of use cases, it won't cover them all, or it will cover some of them better which means other will be less well treated.

So what do we do with this cases ?
