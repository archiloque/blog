where I coded missing behaviors, I'll work on the second level on being able to modify the rules.

image::../baba-is-you-6/second-level1.png[title="Hello level two my old friend",align="center",width=352,height=402]

I'll follow the same steps than for the first level: 

. implement the features required to find a solution
. add the other features

== First: thinking

Before starting the implementation I'll need to plan ahead how to deal with the changing rules.

Looking at the level, the rules are establishing capabilities about game elements: this thing can do this thing, that other thing can do that thing.

By default you can walk through most elements except the tiles that represents rules components.

So I'll try scanning for the rules, adding capabilities as I find them, then process the movements.

Updating the movement code will rely on generalizing the existing behaviors.
For example instead of checking if Baba is stopped by walking against a wall, I'll check if Baba is walking against something that has the stop capability.

include::graph1.asciidoc[]
include::graph2.asciidoc[]

To store the capabilities I'll use bit fields again.
For each capability I'll use a bit field to store which kind of elements the capability should be applied to, using the same mask value used to define which elements are on each tile.

For example

[source,java]
----
if ((targetPositionContent & Tiles.ROCK_MASK) != Tiles.EMPTY) {
----

Will become

[source,java]
----
if ((targetPositionContent & stopTilesMask) != Tiles.EMPTY) {
----

To scan for the rules I need to be able to identify the corresponding tiles, from what I've seen from the game so far, there are three kind of rule tiles:

* the `IS` tile
* the subject tiles, like `Baba` or `flag`
* the tiles that define a capability, like `stop` or `push`

A rule -- as a first approximation -- use the `subject IS definition` form, with the three tiles placed horizontally or vertically.

== Second: generating

So I need to add some info to the `Tile` class to define which tiles are subjects, which tiles are definitions and so on.

I don't want to write this code manually since it would be tedious and error-prone but would prefer to declare it and let the machine deal with it.

So times to do some code generation, which is less scary that it sounds.

Except that the first step is to deal with Maven to transform our single-module project into a multi-modules project, which is definitely scary (and tedious and error-prone).

I skip the boring part, you can find the result in link:https://github.com/archiloque/babaisyousolver[the source], but the target structure is:

[source]

|__engine <5>

                |__tilesgenerator
                  |__TilesGenerator.java <2>
----
<1> Module containing the code generation routine
<2> Class doing the code generation
<3> Module containing the tiles declaration, during build it will use `TilesGenerator` to transform it into a Java file
<4> JSON file where the data are declared
<5> Module containing the solver engine, that will use the generated `Tile` class so depends of the `tiles` module
<6> Parent project that declare all the submodules
<7> Game levels

I use JSON for declaring the data because they are not complex enough to delve in XML, and because I hate YAML with the burning passion of a thousand suns.

I'll implement the generation in two steps: first I'll generate an equivalent of the existing file, then I'll add the new features.

The first version of the JSON file:

.tiles.json
[source,json]
----
include::tiles1.json[]
----

I use link:https://github.com/square/javapoet[JavaPoet] to generate the code instead of doing it manually.

The resulting code is a bit verbose because of the builder pattern used everywhere, but it's easy to write and read.

.TilesGenerator.java
[source,java]
----
include::tilesgenerator1.java[]
----

Then I can run the tests and the app and checks nothing is broken.

I then add the information related to the tiles.

.tiles.json
[source,json]
----
include::tiles2.json[]
----

Each subject contains a link to the entity it deals with so the code can find it.
Since the naming is consistent (the text is named from the entity with " text" appended) I could deduce the entity automatically, but it would be a bit too magical for my taste.

The resulting data in the `Tiles`:

.Tiles.java
[source,java]
----
include::tiles1.java[]
----

The link between the text and the entities is done through a switch method instead of an array because the lookup key is not the text id but the text mask.
For example `ROCK_TEXT_MASK` is equal to 128, which means an array of 128 elements with only four useful values.

I could change the tiles' order to put these ones first and keep the array short, but I like the alphabetical order that is dislike the switch.

== Third: coding

Now the data are available I can work on the new behaviors.

First I add new members to `State` to contain the capabilities.

.State.java
[source,java]
----
include::state1.java[]
----

The text files are pushable by default, the other capabilities are empty at the beginning.

Then the code, which is a direct translation of the algorithm I described before.
I first look for `IS` tiles, then look if the statement if well formed, then add the capability.

.State.java
[source,java]
----
include::state2.java[]
----

The 'YOU' behavior is more complex to implement because it requires to add new business logic, whereas the other only need small code changes.

So I'll implement the other rules first so I'll be able to find a solution for the second level and I'll deal with it later.

I won't change all the behaviors at once and I'll skip the `YOU` part first.

Nearly all the changes are one-liners, were the hardcoded tiles like `Tiles#ROCK_MASK` are replaced by the "`behavior-masks`" like `stopTilesMask`.

The only exception is the pushing part.

When Baba was only pushing rocks, we only needed to teleport the first rock at the end.

From

[subs=+quotes]
----
b**r**rr
----

To

[subs=+quotes]
----
 brr**r**
----

But now all the elements must be moved one by one as the algo looks for a suitable cell.

.State.java
[source,java]
----
include::state3.java[]
----

== Fourth: solving

After checking that the first level still works, it's time to have a look at the second one :

.levels/01/content.txt
[source]
----
include::content1.txt[]
----

And … it works, in a kind of way at least:

.levels/01/solution.txt
[source]
----
1→ 2↓ 5← 1↑ 5→ 9← 9→ 1↓ 1→ 1↑ 10← 1↓ 1← 1↑ 11→ 1↑ 5← 5→ 2↓ 11← 2↑ 9→ 9← 2↓ 11→ 2↑ 1← 1→ 2↓ 11← 2↑ 10→ 10← 2↓ 11→ 2↑ 11← 1↑ 8→ 8← 2↓ 11→ 2↑ 1← 1→ 2↓ 11← 2↑ 9→ 9← 2↓ 11→ 2↑ 1← 1→ 2↓ 11← 2↑ 10→ 10← 2↓ 11→ 2↑ 11← 1↑ 10→ 1↓ 1→ 1↑ 11← 1↑ 10→ 1↓ 1→ 1↑ 11← 1↑ 10→ 1↓ 1→ 1↑ 11← 1↑ 9→ 9← 2↓ 11→ 2↑ 1← 1→ 2↓ 11← 2↑ 10→ 10← 2↓ 11→ 2↑ 11← 1↑ 10→ 1↑ 1← 1→ 2↓ 1→ 2↓ 11← 2↑ 8→ 2↑ 2→ 2↓ 1→ 2↓ 11← 2↑ 6→ 2↑ 5← 1↑ 1← 1↓ 10→ 2↑ 4← 4→ 2↓ 10← 1↓ 10→ 1↓ 1→ 2↓ 11← 3↑ 10→ 2↑ 2← 2→ 2↓ 10← 1↑ 10→ 2↑ 5← 5→ 2↓ 10← 1↑ 9→ 9← 2↓ 10→ 2↑ 10← 1↑ 8→ 8← 2↓ 10→ 2↑ 1← 1→ 2↓ 10← 2↑ 9→ 9← 1↑ 9→ 1↑ 1→ 4↓ 10← 2↓ 10→ 10← 2↑ 10→ 2↓ 10← 2↓ 11→ 1↑ 1← 1→ 2↓ 11← 2↑ 8→ 1↑ 1→ 1↓ 2→ 2↓ 3← 1↑ 2→ 10← 2↓ 11→ 2↑ 11← 2↑ 6→
----

The code found a solution even if it's probably not the shortest, which means I reached my goal.

In the next part I'll add the missing behaviors, before trying to improve the solution.
