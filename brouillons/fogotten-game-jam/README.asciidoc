My first gaming machine was an Amstrad CPC 6218.

During this period, Amstrad computers were popular in France, so pirated games were easy to obtain at school.

At the time games came with paper manuals, meaning that pirated ones didn't come with one.

Me and my gaming school friends were less that 10 years old, many games were difficult to play and to decipher, and there was no internet to provide you with walkthroughs or guides.

Trying systematically different strategies, or drawing maps was not something we understood. 

Gaming magazines published some cheat codes, that required an external physical device to use.

We didn't traded magazines, but exchanged cheat codes for the games we had.

It means there was three games categories:

. The minority of games we could figure by ourselves and that were easy enough to enjoy long play sessions.
. The games that had cheat codes that removed all difficulties. We played them again and again from the start to the end, swapping keyboards and joysticks at each level.
. The other games. We also played them again and again, but often the play sessions were very short as we lost again and again at the same point were the lack of skill or knowledge hit us.

== Asphalt

One of the first games published by a French company then called UBI Soft.

You played as a truck trying to survive against other vehicles that tried to destroy you.

There was no power-up.
Between each level parts of the truck got repaired a little, so your goal was to get as little damage as possible to survive a bit longer.

It means that the winning strategy was to remember the level structure to anticipate were the enemies will come from, and to execute the right movements with the right timing.
Two things we couldn't master.

The truck was slow to move, the levels were long, and the number of different enemies were low, which made the game mesmerizing.

== Batman

35 years ago we add 3D games, but they were isometric.

Those kind of games were pretty popular and were a mix of platform and puzzle games, with sometimes a dash of early metroidvania.

The isometric play required a specific skill to map the up / down / right / left keys to the diagonal movements on the screen.

My experience was that I could do it in the first sections were you have to do one thing at the time.
But when things became more difficult, like when you had to do several timed jumps in a row, I suddenly lost this ability and couldn't figure in which direction I was supposed to move the joystick, and died horribly.

== Boulder Dash

== Captain Blood

A very unusual game at the time, and probably still know.

This science-fiction game was about chatting with different kind of aliens to obtain information, mostly the space coordinates of other aliens so you could visit them to chat with them and extract other information.

The chat interface was based on a set of emoji you could use to compose sentences, each emoji representing a concept (me, you, war, planet, coordinatesâ€¦).
Then the alien answered you another set of emojis.

Being able to chat with different kind on aliens looked impressive, but of course underneath it used link:http://bringerp.free.fr/RE/CaptainBlood/scripts.php5[a limited set of rules].

Progressing in the game required to discover the more or less exact sentences you had to use on each alien so it would give you the information you need.

The play session were limited on the first
