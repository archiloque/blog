== How software manifestos sounded when I was young

* EATING BURNING HOT LAVA OVER GETTING ICE CREAM
* TRANSFORMING INTO A HUMONGOUS STAR-SHAPED ENTITY OVER KEEPING YOUR HUMAN FORM
* LIVING OUTSIDE SPACE AND TIME OVER ACCEPTING PHYSICAL REALITY
* KILLING GOD WITH YOUR BARE HANDS OVER LIVING A HAPPY LIFE

WE AGREE THE ITEMS ON THE RIGHT EXISTS, BUT WE'LL MOCK YOU MERCYLESSLY IF YOU THINK THEY HAVE ANY VALUE.

== How software manifestos sound now

* working code is nice, in some case it's better that non-working code
* trying to do useful thing may be something to explore, but no biggie
* software development is often easier if you have a computer at your disposal, but ymmv
* this is a little fourth item, because all software manifestos should have four items

we hope you have a pleasant day, xoxo
