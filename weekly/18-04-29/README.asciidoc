Philosophically, there`'s a lot to like about Redis Cluster`' design â€“ simple, yet powerful. Especially when it comes to distributed systems, many implementations are exceedingly complicated, and that level of complexity can be catastrophic when encountering a tricky edge in production.
Redis Cluster is scalable, and yet with few enough moving parts that even a layperson like myself can wrap their head around what it`'s doing. Its design doc is comprehensive, but also approachable.
