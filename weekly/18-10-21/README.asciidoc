We started with a couple of examples that illustrate how many of the exploratory activities related to programming can be considered labyrinthine. We confronted the difficulties of sharing our journey through the maze—difficulties that arise because the linearity of language forces us to share a _path_ from what was once a _graph_, an act of compression that obscures critical details. But by seeing these processes as labyrinths, we can learn how to share our journey with our colleagues in a way that enhances their understanding of why we arrived at certain solutions.
