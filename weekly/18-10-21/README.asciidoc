We started with a couple of examples that illustrate how many of the exploratory activities related to programming can be considered labyrinthine. We confronted the difficulties of sharing our journey through the maze -- difficulties that arise because the linearity of language forces us to share a _path_ from what was once a _graph_, an act of compression that obscures critical details. But by seeing these processes as labyrinths, we can learn how to share our journey with our colleagues in a way that enhances their understanding of why we arrived at certain solutions.
