In these systems, there are multiple services each with its own code and data, and ability to operate independently of its partners.
In particular, atomic transactions with two-phase commit do not occur across multiple services because this necessitates holding locks while another service decides the outcome of the transaction.
This paper proposes there are a number of seminal differences between data inside a service and data sent into the space outside of the service boundary.

Going to SOA is like going from Newton's physics to Einstein's physics.

* Newton's time marched forward uniformly with instant knowledge at a distance.
* Before SOA, distributed computing strove to make many systems look like one with RPC, 2PC, etc.
* In Einstein's universe, everything is relative to one's perspective.
* SOA has "`now`" inside and the "`past`" arriving in messages.
