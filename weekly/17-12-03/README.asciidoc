It's Radar season at ThoughtWorks, which means we're all working hard to get the next Technology Radar ready for release on November 30. During Radar season, sleeping is overrated.

Jokes apart, I've been involved in a couple of Radars now. One question I get asked frequently -- and I used to ask myself before I got involved -- is: "`How is the Tech Radar created?`". In this article, I'll give you under-the-hood insights into what goes on, how we prepare and how decisions are made. It all starts with a four-day meeting.
