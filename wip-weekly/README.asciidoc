The link:https://agilemanifesto.org/[Agile Manifesto] is an immune response on the part of programmers to bad management. The document is link:https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html[an expression of trauma], and its intellectual descendants continue to carry this baggage. While the Agile era has brought about remarkable advancements in project management techniques and development tools, it remains a tactical, technical, and ultimately reactionary movement. As long as Agile remains in this position it will be liable to backfire, vulnerable to the very depredations of bad management it had initially evolved to counter.
