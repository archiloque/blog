The nasty thing with programming languages is that good design is often a _holistic_ property. Certain features only make sense in the presence (or absence!) of other features. We’re going to be exploring a lot of different concepts in this post, and it’s important to keep in mind that they don’t work in a vacuum. They solve specific problems caused by solutions to _other_ specific problems, caused by solutions to **other other** problems.
