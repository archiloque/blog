There`'s a story I like to tell, which I vaguely remembered as originating at Bell Labs or Xerox PARC. A researcher had a rubber duck in his office. When he found himself stumped on a problem, he would pick up the duck, walk over to a colleague, and ask them to hold the duck. He would proceed to explain the problem, often realizing the solution himself in the middle of the explanation. Then he would say, "`Thank you for holding my duck`", and leave.

I love this story. Years ago, Tamar Shinar and I agreed that the "`Thank you for holding my duck`" expression is better if it is understood to not mean the colleague didnâ€™t contribute, as then it can be used in boundary cases without slight. But finally, someone asked for the source, and I looked for one and failed.
