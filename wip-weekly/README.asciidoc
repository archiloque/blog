Long before infinite scrolling or pull-to-refresh, the scrollbar solved the web’s first scaling problem: how to situate yourself within content that stretched beyond the visible screen. Somewhere along the way, the usage changed and became a fuel for motion. A motion I can’t really control and a motion I can’t really resist.
Getting lost is a rational fear. I will miss knowing where I am. I will miss the sense that I am tethered to something, that I am not just scrolling but moving with intention.
