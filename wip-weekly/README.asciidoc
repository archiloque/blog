Indeed, defining latency queues (`+latency_15s+`, `+latency_15m+`, `+latency_8h+`) is much better. Because if the high priority queue is always busy, others will never start. However, with the idea of SLO latency, we could totally get rid of queues.

A job needs two attributes to define when it should be started: run_at and max_latency. That means the job worker only needs to order them by `+run_at + max_latency+`, and takes the first. It seems both flexible and simple.
