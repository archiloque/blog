Another idea I've been experimenting with is encoding a standard set of text tiers as link:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdomain.html[domains], which defines a new data type with more constraints:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE DOMAIN text_standard AS varchar(200) COLLATE "C";
CREATE DOMAIN text_long AS varchar(2000) COLLATE "C";
CREATE DOMAIN text_huge AS varchar(20000) COLLATE "C";

In Postgres, `inet`/`cidr` sort according to these rules:

. IPv4 always appears before IPv6.
. The bits in the network are compared (`1.2.3.`).
. Netmask size is compared (`/24`).
. All bits are compared. Having made it here, we know that the network bits are equal, so we're in effect just comparing the subnet (`.4`).

These rules combined with the fact that we're working at the bit level produces ordering that in cases may not be intuitive. For example, `192.0.0.0/1` sorts _before_ `128.0.0.0/2` despite 192 being the larger number -- when comparing them, we start by looking at the common bits available in both networks, which comes out to just one bit (`min(/1, /2)`). That bit is the same in the networks of both values (remember, 192 = `1100 0000` and 128 = `1000 0000`), so we fall through to comparing netmask size. `/2` is the larger of the two, so `128.0.0.0/2` is the larger value.

What I did realize I could say, as a sort of ha-ha-distancing-myself-making-myself-very-small joke was that "`of course yes, I have several unfinished novels`" because this is both true and depressing, as opposed to true and evidence of progress and attempts at writing a novel.

It is very easy, I have found, to not write a book.

All of this is to say that there is one rule I must accept if I want to be the kind of person who has finished writing a novel:

* you have to write
* frequently and often
* until it is finished
