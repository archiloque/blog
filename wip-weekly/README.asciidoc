I have criticized the _Accelerate_ research and its presentation
extensively, so I should reiterate up front that I believe in most of
the practices advanced under the "`devops`" banner (by the _Accelerate_
authors and many others). I mean, like, "`version control`"? Yes, you
should use it! And continuous integration, and trunk-based development,
and so forth, I believe all that stuff is good, and we do it at my day
job.

But I don't believe in it _because of this research_. There are too many
issues with the methodology and presentation to be fully credible.

Admittedly, the _Accelerate_ research is evidence of something â€” at a
minimum, evidence of how engineers might verbally describe their
practices in a broad sample of software development teams. But I claim
that it is not _convincing evidence of the superiority of the exact
software development methods studied_.

A. Tabarrok has coined the aphorism
link:https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/12/why-the-new-pollution-literature-is-credible.html["`trust
literatures not papers`"], and that applies here. Of the original book's
extensive claims, only a small subset, which appeared in just two papers
by Forsgren et al., were formally peer reviewed at all. Some of the
authors' subsequent work has also been peer reviewed, but all of it
constitutes essentially a single line of research, using methods that I
find dubious. This does not add up to a literature, let alone a
convincing one.

Second, stop citing _Accelerate_ and the "`State of DevOps`" reports
uncritically. Until the literature is shored up considerably, it's
misleading to your readers to cite these results as settled questions
with hard evidence behind them. I promise you that it is possible to
make the case for your preferred set of software development practices
some other way.

Third, stop giving credence to other people who cite _Accelerate_ and
the "`State of DevOps`" reports with more certainty than the work
warrants. I recently watched a terrible video by a Youtube personality
(not one of the _Accelerate_ authors) who dogmatically and arrogantly
insisted that it was not "`scientific`" or "`rational`" to dispute any
aspect of their preferred development style, citing these sources as
proof. As I hope this review makes clear, anybody who talks this way is
ironically revealing their own deficient skills in close reading and
critical thinking. I suggest you stop paying attention to people like
that.
