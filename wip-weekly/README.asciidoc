A truly post-authentic sincere attitude is synonymous with "`normcore`", as originally defined in K-HOLEâ€™s trend report Youth Mode, a timely and groundbreaking publication released in 2013 as the last embers of Hipsterism were fading.To crudely summarize highlights of the analysis: The opposite of mass authenticity-seeking, which they name "`Mass Indie`", is the normcore attitude. The normcore derives value from popularity and recognition, not scarcity. The pursuit of uniqueness is devalued; dynamicism and flexibility are more important than originality, because originality itself is unattainable. One of the first declarations in the publication is "`Normcore is about adaptability, not exclusivity`". Adaptability is the key characteristic of the normcore attitude, the true post-authentic attitude.
