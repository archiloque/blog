As a brief aside, I would argue that simply knowing about Hyrum’s Law turns it into a self-fulfilling prophecy. In other words: As the number of developers aware of Hyrum’s Law increases, so too will the number of developers using it as an excuse to exploit every observable behavior. If that number ever reaches 0, assume I am dead.
