== link:https://www.devever.net/~hl/stringtemplates[Producing HTML using string templates has always been the wrong solution]

[quote]
____
There are broadly two approaches used to generate (X)HTML in web
applications today:

* string templating systems;
* AST-based representation, transformation and serialization;

Historically, the majority of server-side web applications have tended
to produce HTML output using string templating systems. String template
approaches remain vastly more popular than AST-based approaches.

This is unfortunate, as I've come to the conclusion for some years now
that the use of string templating systems to generate HTML is
fundamentally the wrong approach.
