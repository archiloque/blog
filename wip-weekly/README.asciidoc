Today, Internet Explorer has been consigned to the dustbin of history,
yet its quirks and peculiar features remain an interesting area of
discussion from a historical perspective. There was one particular
feature of IE which not only now seems comically naive, but also
completely impractical: namely, IE tried to pioneer a system of content
rating.

This was essentially a standardised "`parental controls`" system. The idea
was that a webpage could be rated in terms of the profanity, nudity,
sex, violence, etc. that it contained.
