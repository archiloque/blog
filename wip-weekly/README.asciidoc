Soâ€¦ link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree[git worktree]. Much like
sliced bread.

The main selling point is: keep multiple working directories out of a
single repository, so that we can work on them in parallel.

Many people praise this for being able to quickly work on a critical fix
in a branch without having to mess with their current working directory.
The stuff that was mainly addressed with `git stash` up to some time
ago, except that now it seems everybody secretly hated that.

For starters, I think that `git stash` is cool. Maybe outdated by
multiple working trees, but still cool.
